# Particle Swarm Optimization
This is a simple implementation of the PSO algorithm in python.

Particle Swarm Optimization is a computational method that solves the optimization problem.   It is a hurestic algorithm that is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking.

## How to use the code?
just simply run the code using the following command:  
```python pso.py``` or  
```python pso.py -h```  
for tips on modify the params that you prefer.

## Outcomes
The code will generate a gif file that shows the process of the algorithm.
